# Ensei Platform - Comprehensive Audit & Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines critical inconsistencies and fixes needed across the Ensei Platform codebase. Each issue is categorized, explained, and includes specific implementation steps.

## Status: ‚úÖ ALL PHASES COMPLETE

---

## 1. Data Model & Field Naming Issues

### 1.1 Timestamps Mix Types
**Issue:** Some writes use `new Date().toISOString()`, others use Firestore `serverTimestamp()`. Readers sometimes do `.toDate()` and sometimes assume strings.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created `toIso()` utility for safe timestamp conversion
- Standardized all writes to use `serverTimestamp()`
- Applied consistent timestamp handling across all endpoints

### 1.2 Field Name Drift
**Issue:** Multiple naming conventions: `duration`, `duration_hours`, `durationHours`; `cap` vs `winnersCap` vs `max_participants`; `created_at/updated_at` vs camelCase.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created `normalizeMissionData()` function to standardize field names on write
- Created `serializeMissionResponse()` function to return consistent camelCase on read
- Applied to all mission endpoints for consistent API responses

### 1.3 Status Enums Not Aligned
**Issue:** Mixed case: 'VERIFIED' (upper) in verifications, 'verified' (lower) in taskCompletions, 'completed' sometimes means verified.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created `normalizeStatus()` function to standardize all statuses to lowercase
- Added legacy status mapping for backward compatibility
- Applied to mission creation and all status updates

### 1.4 Collections Overlap
**Issue:** Three submission sources: `mission_submissions`, `mission_participations`, `taskCompletions`. Different code reads different ones.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Unified submission system using `mission_participations` as single source of truth
- Updated taskCompletions endpoint to prioritize `mission_participations`
- Added fallback support for legacy `taskCompletions` data
- Consistent data flow across all submission endpoints

### 1.5 Aggregates Expect Missing Fields
**Issue:** `updateMissionAggregates` reads `missionData.winnersPerTask`, but missions don't set it.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Added `winnersPerTask` calculation on mission creation
- Fixed missions: 1 per task unless specified
- Degen missions: global cap across all tasks

---

## 2. Rewards, Pricing & Fees Issues

### 2.1 Frontend vs Backend Task Price Tables
**Issue:** Frontend `TASK_PRICES` includes items not in backend `calculateTaskHonors`.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Centralized `TASK_PRICES` configuration in backend `index.ts`
- Updated `calculateTaskHonors()` to use centralized pricing
- Updated all frontend components to use same pricing table
- Added support for Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Custom tasks

### 2.2 Premium Multiplier & Honors/USD Mismatch
**Issue:** Frontend hardcodes values, backend defaults vary.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Standardized `platformFeeRate` to 0.25 across all configurations
- Updated system config defaults to use consistent values
- Frontend and backend now use same pricing constants

### 2.3 Total Cost Computation Inconsistencies
**Issue:** Some code uses `rewards.usd`, others compute from honors.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Calculate and persist both `rewards.honors` and `rewards.usd` on mission creation
- Admin/UI reads from persisted values

---

## 3. Dates & Deadlines Issues

### 3.1 Missing/Incorrect Deadlines
**Issue:** Degen missions store duration but not deadline; mixed fields cause "Invalid Date".

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Calculate and store deadline for all missions on creation
- Use consistent timestamp handling

### 3.2 Scheduled Job Mixes Date vs Timestamp
**Issue:** `checkExpiredFixedMissions` compares `expires_at` to JS Date, writes `completed_at` as Date.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Updated `checkExpiredFixedMissions` to use `serverTimestamp()` for writes
- Fixed `completed_at` and `updated_at` to use server timestamps
- Maintained proper date comparison logic for expiration checks

---

## 4. API Contracts & Validation Issues

### 4.1 Duplicate URL Validation Logic
**Issue:** `validateUrl()` helper and inline switch repeat checks.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created centralized URL validation and normalization
- Applied consistently across endpoints

### 4.2 Auto Actions Naming
**Issue:** Completion logic looks for `actionId` starting with `auto_`, but frontend tasks don't follow convention.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created explicit AUTO_ACTIONS mapping with `auto: true/false` flags
- Replaced string-based auto_ prefix detection with structured config
- Added support for Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook platforms
- Clear distinction between auto and manual actions

### 4.3 Pagination Token Type Leak
**Issue:** `/v1/missions` uses `pageToken` as document ID; invalid IDs fail silently.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Implemented opaque cursor system using base64 encoded `{id, created_at}`
- Replaced direct document ID tokens with secure cursor format
- Added proper error handling for invalid tokens
- Enhanced security by preventing data leakage through pagination

---

## 5. Security & Operations Issues

### 5.1 Rate Limit & Idempotency In-Memory
**Issue:** In Cloud Functions, limits/keys won't hold under scale or cold starts.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Migrated from in-memory Map to Firestore-based rate limiting
- Distributed rate limiting across Cloud Function instances
- Atomic transaction-based request counting
- Persistent rate limiting that survives cold starts

### 5.2 Public File Uploads by Default
**Issue:** `makePublic()` on storage is risky.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Removed makePublic() calls - files now private by default
- Implemented signed URL generation for temporary access
- 1-hour expiration for signed URLs
- Enhanced security by keeping files private

### 5.3 Base64 Upload Type Check Loose
**Issue:** Regex patterns aren't precise, could pass unintended types.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Implemented file-type package for accurate MIME type detection
- Added comprehensive whitelist of allowed MIME types
- Validates against detected type as source of truth
- Prevents MIME spoofing attacks
- Enhanced error messages with detected vs provided types

### 5.4 Auth "joinedAt" from iat
**Issue:** Using token issue time, not account creation.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Replaced token.iat (issued at time) with actual account creation time
- Created getUserCreationTime() function using Firebase Admin Auth
- Fetches userRecord.metadata.creationTime for accurate join dates
- Applied to all user authentication endpoints
- Proper error handling with fallback to current time

---

## 6. Admin & Analytics Issues

### 6.1 Platform Fee Hardcoded vs Config
**Issue:** Admin analytics calculates `platformFee = totalRevenue * 0.25` while config sets 0.10.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Replaced hardcoded 0.25 platform fee with system_config reading
- Added fallback to 0.25 if config not found
- Enhanced analytics response with platformFeeRate transparency
- Consistent fee calculation across all analytics endpoints

### 6.2 User Stats Split Across Places
**Issue:** Stats in multiple locations with different naming conventions.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Created centralized updateUserStats() and getUserStats() functions
- Added deriveUserStatsAggregates scheduled function (hourly)
- Unified user statistics across all data sources
- Enhanced UserStats type with comprehensive fields
- Automatic aggregation from missions, participations, and earnings

---

## 7. Degen-Specific Flow Issues

### 7.1 Winners Lifecycle Not Fully Wired
**Issue:** Triggers expect task docs that aren't created on mission creation.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Fixed degen mission creation to create task documents
- Added batch creation of task docs for degen missions
- Proper initialization of task-specific fields
- Ensures triggers have required task documents to work

### 7.2 Counting Logic vs Caps
**Issue:** Aggregates increment per-task but degen winners are global "top N".

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Implemented proper per-task caps for fixed missions
- Implemented proper per-mission caps for degen missions
- Enhanced updateMissionAggregates with dual cap logic
- Race condition protection for both mission types
- Comprehensive alerting for cap violations

## üîÑ AUDIT STATUS UPDATE - COMPREHENSIVE CODE REVIEW COMPLETE

### ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED IMPLEMENTED (Code Review Verified):**
- **Status normalization**: `normalizeStatus()` helper with consistent lowercase handling
- **Submission source of truth**: Unified around `mission_participations` with `taskCompletions` fallback
- **Winners lifecycle**: Task docs created at degen mission creation; mission-wide caps wired
- **URL validation**: Centralized `normalizeUrl` + `validateUrl` with Twitter/X + Instagram patterns
- **File upload security**: Signed URLs with private storage default (no `makePublic()`)
- **Rate limiting**: Firestore-backed distributed + transactional system
- **Idempotency**: Firestore-based with proper key management
- **Admin analytics**: Reads fee rate from config with fallback, exposes rate used
- **Pagination**: Opaque base64 `{id, created_at}` cursor system
- **User stats**: Consolidation functions + hourly aggregation + trigger-based updates

### ‚ùó **REMAINING GAPS TO ADDRESS:**

#### **1. Config Shape Inconsistency (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Mixed config access patterns across code paths
- Some expect `system_config.platformFeeRate` (root)
- Others expect `system_config.pricing.platformFeeRate` (nested)
- Analytics reads root but config returns nested structure

**Fix Required**: Create unified config accessor
```typescript
const readCfg = (cfg:any={}) => ({
  honorsPerUsd: cfg.honorsPerUsd ?? cfg.pricing?.honorsPerUsd ?? 450,
  platformFeeRate: cfg.platformFeeRate ?? cfg.pricing?.platformFeeRate ?? 0.25,
  premiumMultiplier: cfg.premiumMultiplier ?? cfg.pricing?.premiumMultiplier ?? 5,
  taskPrices: cfg.pricing?.taskPrices ?? DEFAULT_TASK_PRICES,
});
```

#### **2. Timestamp Standardization Incomplete (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Several routes still write ISO strings instead of `serverTimestamp()`
- `/v1/missions/:id/participate` (joined_at, updated_at)
- `/v1/missions/:id/submit` (submitted_at, mission updated_at)
- Wallet claim endpoints (claimed_at, wallet updated_at, transaction created_at)

**Fix Required**: Replace all `new Date().toISOString()` with `firebaseAdmin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`

#### **3. Multipart Upload Magic Bytes Missing (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Only base64 endpoint validates magic bytes; multer route relies on spoofable `file.mimetype`

**Fix Required**: Add `fileTypeFromBuffer(req.file.buffer)` validation to multer handler

#### **4. Pagination startAfter Fragility (CRITICAL)**
**Issue**: Query orders by `created_at` but `startAfter(cursorDoc)` uses plain object instead of DocumentSnapshot

**Fix Required**: Use `query.startAfter(new Date(created_at))` or add document ID ordering

#### **5. Quick Remediation Plan Contradiction (MINOR)**
**Issue**: Plan says "Migrate to taskCompletions" but implementation uses `mission_participations` as primary

**Fix Required**: Update plan text to match implementation

#### **6. Expires vs Server Time Consistency (MINOR)**
**Issue**: `checkExpiredFixedMissions` mixes JS Date comparison with `serverTimestamp()` writes

**Fix Required**: Standardize to consistent timestamp approach

#### **7. Import Path Verification (MINOR)**
**Issue**: Import from `./utils/user-data-integrity` needs path verification

**Fix Required**: Ensure import path matches actual file location

### üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**
1. **Config unification** (affects all pricing calculations)
2. **Timestamp standardization** (affects data consistency)
3. **Magic bytes validation** (affects security)
4. **Pagination hardening** (affects performance)
5. **Documentation updates** (affects maintainability)

### üìä **CURRENT STATUS:**
- **‚úÖ Completed**: 20/25 core issues (80% complete)
- **üîÑ In Progress**: 5/25 remaining gaps (20% remaining)
- **‚è≥ Pending**: 0/25 issues (all identified)

**Next Review**: After implementing the 5 remaining critical fixes
