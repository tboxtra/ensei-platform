   - 🟡 Yellow: Pending tasks
   - 🔵 Blue: Not completed

2. Find a verified submission
3. Click "Flag" button
4. Select a reason and submit
5. **Expected**: 
   - Status immediately changes to "Flagged" (red)
   - No page reload needed
   - Verification button starts blinking

#### **C. Test Resubmission**
1. Go back to `http://localhost:3000/missions`
2. Find the flagged task
3. **Expected**:
   - Task button is red with flag icon

## 🔍 What to Look For

### **Visual Changes:**
- ✅ Red task buttons with flag icons for flagged tasks
- ✅ Tooltips showing flagged reasons on hover
- ✅ Blinking verification buttons for resubmissions
- ✅ "Redo Task" button text for flagged tasks
- ✅ No page reloads when flagging/reverifying

### **Behavior Changes:**
- ✅ Instant status updates (no page reload)
- ✅ Silent success/error handling (no alert popups)
- ✅ Proper status indicators (✓, ⏳, 🚩)

## 🚨 If Changes Aren't Visible

### **Possible Issues:**
1. **Server not running**: Make sure `npm run dev` is running
2. **Browser cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **No test data**: Need missions with task completions to test
4. **Wrong page**: Make sure you're on the right pages

### **Debug Steps:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify server is running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check if you have missions with task completions
4. Try creating a test mission and completing tasks

## 📝 Test Data Needed

To see the changes, you need:
- Missions with task completions
- Some completed tasks (verified status)
- Some flagged tasks (flagged status)

If you don't have test data, the changes won't be visible because they only affect tasks that have been completed and flagged.
